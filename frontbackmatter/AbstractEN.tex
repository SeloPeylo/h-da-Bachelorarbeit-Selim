	\chapter*{Abstract}
	As early users of IT systems, banks have established a complex IT architecture that is subject to regulatory requirements and is regularly audited. However, approaches and technologies in the software development process are constantly evolving. Continuous integration platforms are confronted with an increasing frequency of build jobs. The platform delegates build jobs to agents that were previously provided with persistent virtual machines. Their scalability is limited by an inflexible environment and long-running processes. For continuous integration, it requires a scalable and flexible environment with new approaches such as cloud computing and container virtualization. In the worst case, lack of scalability can lead to non-compliance with protection goals such as the availability of development systems which is not acceptable, especially for companies with high protection requirements.

	\chapter*{Abstract}
	As early users of IT systems, banks have established an outdated IT architecture that has been able to successfully withstand a whole series of innovations over the years. 
    For CI/CD it requires an environment with agile approaches. The inflexible IT architecture is additionally limited by inefficient processes and risk measures and is consequently paralyzed against changes. The inability to act before an unavoidable collision is fatal.
    The implementation of one of the most effective innovations of recent years, cloud computing, is causing disruptions in the legacy IT of banks, making a transformation of the entire organization unavoidable.
